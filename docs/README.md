# Vision

We believe that communication is a fundamental human right. Many people with impaired speech and other language difficulties require symbols to support their communication needs, to enable their desires, wishes and opinions to be expressed.

These symbols are provided as a resource for speech and language professionals or developers to use in communication aids. We also hope new exciting uses will be found.

* Designed to overcome high costs experienced by symbols users - free at point of use
* Foster innovation by allowing reuse and derivations, including internationalisation
* Adult oriented symbols - most proprietary sets are designed for children
* Unusual symbols usually missing from proprietary sets
* Designed by graphics artists, reviewed by SLTs and coloured by people with mental health issues
